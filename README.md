## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project started after years of manual administration of a Plex server and associated services. It's focus is to automate standing up and updating a wide array of applications. Utilizing cloud storage via Rclone, and Duplicacy to backup application data.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Clone the repo locally and make a copy of the vars.yml.example file to fill out with your variables. You will notice a significant portion of the vars use the lastpass lookup to pull their contents. I did this to keep next to no personal information in the playbook, and to prevent any secrets from making it into the codebase. Handle your secrets how you see fit. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This playbook is currently compatiable with Ansible 2.9.6. The playbook is currently designed to be run on a bare-metal Ubuntu Server 20.04 based system. As the vast majority of the roles only interact with the docker service, you should be able to modify this to work on your OS of choice by modifying the host-setup role.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

If you are starting with a clean slate, you will have to configure many of the applications yourself through their GUI. If you have appdata from previous installations, you should be able to import this data to the respective applications appdata folder. Verify that the paths match up with the volumes and paths expected for each container.

Following the pre-defined container paths on both the host side and container side for the Docker bind volumes is highly recommended. The current layout is able to take advantage of direct writes and hardlinking. Using a different folder structure should work, but you may see increased overhead.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

After modifying your own vars file, the host-setup role should be ran solo. This will prepare the host environment. After that, all Core Services roles should be run.
